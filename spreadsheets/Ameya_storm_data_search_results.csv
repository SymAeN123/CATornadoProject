This storm produced several inches of rainfall across the area. The intense rainfall produced areas of flash flooding across Ventura and Los Angeles counties, including a mud and debris flow near the Griffith Park burn area. The storm brought in a significant amounts of cold air which lowered snow levels to around 2500 feet at the height of the storm. Several inches of snowfall was reported between 2500 and 4000 feet while areas above 4000 feet received several feet of snowfall. This heavy snowfall closed Highway 33 in Ventura county as well as Interstate 5 through the Grapevine in Los Angeles county. Between 300 and 500 vehicles were stranded along Interstate 5 on Wednesday night, January 23rd. Near the Mountain High Ski Resort several avalanches occurred, killing 3 skiers.

The damage assessment indicated that this weak tornado was associated with a small severe thunderstorm that developed just southwest of Visalia and moved northeast across the west portion of the city and to the northeast of the city between about noon and 1230 pm on january 27, 2008. The damage survey indicated the tornado touched down near a mobile home park along Akers Street on the west side of the city. Damage occurred across the park with several medium to large sized shallow rooted trees uprooted, fences downed, branches removed, and shingles and carports damaged. Several medium sized trees were downed onto homes or garages causing moderate damage to those homes. The tops of several trees were damaged and some fences were blown in different directions, suggesting this event was caused by a weak tornado, in addition to the discovery of a small damage path. National Weather Service doppler radar also indicated rotation within the lowest levels of the storm at the time of the event. Eyewitness accounts of a loud roaring noise, funnel clouds, and large debris/dust clouds also occurred near the mobile home park and contributed to the storm survey. The tornado likely continued for up to two miles to the northeast as additional similar damage was discovered along Goshen Avenue near the Visalia Municipal Golf Course. Minor damage also occurred in other parts of Visalia with a few utility poles and trees and branches downed, likely from straight-line wind damage due to the outflow of the severe thunderstorm.","During an already very active month, the final storm of January left a considerable impact on many communities in Central California. An upper-level low pressure system dropped south along the California coast, kicking a low pressure system inland. This weather system became nearly stationary southwest of Point Conception on the 26th. This low brought strong downslope winds through the Tejon Pass into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Southeast winds with sustained speeds of 68 mph were measured at the base of the Grapevine for about 2 hours late in the evening of January 26th, with a gust to 65 mph reported as far north as Bakersfield. The gust was on the east side of the city; the highest gust measured at Meadows Field Airport was 49 mph.||This storm also had enough cold air, initially, to produce heavy snowfall in the Sierra Nevada. Totals ranged generally between 12 to 30 inches in the higher terrain during the first two days of this storm event, January 26-27.||Subtropical moisture spinning around the low brought heavy rain to the Tehachapi Mountains west of the Grapevine. Because of the subtropical nature of the moisture, the snow levels were high and warm rain fell on the nearly 2 feet of snow at Frazier Park from the previous storm. As the ground saturated, mud slides developed on the mountain slopes, closing Frazier Mountain Park Road and triggering the issuance of a Flash Flood Warning for mud and debris flows. Rainwater runoff from the Tejon Pass flowed into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, causing flooding on parts of Copus and David Roads as well.||In the Kern County desert, heavy rain falling on the El Paso Mountains resulted in flooding of the Garlock and Red Rock Roads along the south flanks of the mountains in Kern County.||The warm, unstable airmass also triggered outbreaks of severe thunderstorms over portions of the San Joaquin Valley on the 27th, especially in Tulare and Fresno Counties. A severe thunderstorm developed south of Visalia shortly after noon, and spawned a weak tornado that knocked down trees and severely damaged a trailer park. The tornado, rated EF-0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with peak winds of 70 mph, was the first tornado to hit the San Joaquin Valley since March 28, 2006, when an EF-0 tornado touched down 1 mile southeast of the city of Merced. The last tornado to hit Tulare County had been an F-0 that touched down 5 miles southeast of Dinuba on October 20, 2004.||A strong thunderstorm formed shortly after 4 PM on the 27th, again just south of Visalia, and then passed over the east side of the city. This storm was weaker than the earlier thunderstorm, but did produce one-quarter inch hail and damaging wind gusts. ||The large Pacific storm continued through the 28th. Fresno recorded another third of an inch of rain that day, and winds gusted to 33 mph at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport. Very little rain fell over the south end of the Valley, with Bakersfield getting a total of only 0.01 inch of rain for the three-day event, although winds did gust to 37 mph at Meadows Field on the 28th. A weak upper-level low pressure trough, trailing the storm, moved through central California on the 29th, keeping unsettled weather over the region right through the end of the month.",67

At the time of the report, the funnel had lifted and was dissipating. The touchdown occurred during a period of several funnel cloud reports over an area from Atwater to southeast of Merced Municipal Airport (KMCE).","An upper-level low pressure system moved into California on February 6th, heralding a change in the pattern to wetter than normal for the rest of the month. This was the first in a series of systems that would move through the state over the coming week. Bakersfield received a record rainfall of 0.73 inch on the 7th, nearly twice the old record of 0.41 inch (1993). Heavy snowfall occurred in the Sierra Nevada from Yosemite to Sequoia. Reports of snowfall topped over one foot in some portions of the high country on the 6th.  A very cold airmass settled over interior California on the 8th, dropping snow levels into the Sierra Nevada foothills and setting the stage for an active weather day on the 9th.||The second, and stronger, upper-level trough moved into central California during the morning of February 9th. Snow levels plummeted during the morning, with snow falling on the San Joaquin Valley floor in western Kern County. Snow fell as far into the Valley as Maricopa, ad an inch of snow fell on Taft. Grocer Grade through the Temblors was closed due to snow, and a Winter Weather Advisory was issued for the southwestern San Joaquin Valley. Snow also fell on the Kern County desert floor near Rosamond. Additional snowfall of one foot or more occurred on the 8th and 9th with the second wave of precipitation across the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada. Snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches also occurred in the Sierra Foothills between 2000 to 4000 feet. ||Thunderstorms developed over the central San Joaquin Valley by late morning. Funnel clouds were reported over Merced County at 11:20 AM PST, heralding the start of a 25-minute outbreak that saw at least 4, and probably 5, separate funnels. (Media, public and law-enforcement reports included some multiple sightings of the same funnel clouds, leading to the uncertainty in the number.) These funnel clouds developed from just south of Atwater to 14 miles southeast of the city of Merced. At 11:32 AM PST, the Oakland FAA Flight Service Office called with a report from a pilot over Merced County who had just observed one of the funnels briefly touch down in an open field 10 miles south of Castle Airport. Because of the brevity of the touchdown (only a few seconds) and fortunate lack of damage, this tornado was likely an EF-0 on the enhanced Fujita scale. This was the first tornado to touch down in the central/southern San Joaquin Valley (and the entire Hanford Warning/Forecast Area) since the Visalia tornado on January 27th, 2008. The last tornado to occur in Merced County was on March 28th, 2006.||After the trough moved east of California, the very cold airmass remained over the San Joaquin Valley, bringing frost to the area on the morning of February 10th.

The last tornado in Fresno county was on May 9th, 2005, near the city of Fowler.","By January 13th, the medium-range forecast models were becoming consistent in predicting a major precipitation event that would affect interior central California beginning the 17th and continuing for several days. A series of Special Weather Statements were issued to prepare emergency officials and the public on the upcoming change in the weather, followed by Winter Storm Watches for the Southern Sierra Nevada and the Tehachapi Mountains, beginning January 16th and upgraded to Warnings the next day.||Global composite satellite loops on January 17th showed a series of at least 5 distinct storms stretching roughly along the 40-degree latitude line from the California coast westward across the Pacific and into northeastern China. This line of storms had similarities to the storms of January-February 1998 that brought flooding to the central and southern San Joaquin Valley, but there were some significant differences.||While both events occurred during El Ninos, the 1998 event brought warm, subtropical moisture that eroded the mountain snowpack and appreciably added to the runoff. While the event of January 2010 was similarly moisture-laden, surges of cold air kept snow levels low, and snow even fell on the Southern Sierra Nevada foothills on January 21st-22nd. In addition, the spacing between the storms in the recent event allowed for several-hour breaks between the first few storms, enabling the ground to absorb some of the moisture before the runoff from the next storm hit. This is not to say that was not some flooding in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley, but most was either due to clogged storm drains or occurred in normally flood-prone areas.||The first storm moved rapidly through central California during the afternoon and evening of January 17th. Despite its fast movement, the storm dropped around a half inch of rain over much of the central and southern San Joaquin Valley.||A stronger storm followed the next day, bringing severe weather to the central California interior. Strong winds over the Tehachapi Mountains ahead of the storm caused the first of two storm-related fatalities during the week-long event. At about 9:30 AM, winds toppled at tree near Pine Mountain Club, west of Frazier Park. The tree fell onto a house, killing the occupant. Later that day, a brief EF0 tornado���the first of the year for interior central California���was reported on the west side of Fresno at 3:23 PM during the afternoon of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday on the 18th.

Snow levels with this storm were lower than expected-down to around 4000 feet. Runoff resulted in some road flooding, and creeks in rural areas ran high. The other storm-related fatality occurred that evening, when a man drove around barriers in an attempt to cross a flooded road near the Merced County-Stanislaus County line. The road had been flooded by the Orestimba Creek, and the driver was swept away by the fast current.||Storm number 4 reached central California around midday of January 20th, and pushed across the region during the afternoon and evening hours. This storm dropped snow on the Grapevine and triggered isolated early evening thunderstorms. Also, strong winds occurred in the central valley. Bakersfield reported a wind gust around noon of 46 mph; Merced had a 48 mph sustained wind with a 61 mph wind gust around 2:00 PM that afternoon. There were numerous reports of wind damage, including downed trees and broken roof shingles, throughout the valley that week, especially on the 20th.||The last storm of the series arrived on the 21st, bringing very cold air to the region. Snow levels dropped to around 2200 feet, with snow falling in the towns of Mariposa and Oakhurst. Both the Grapevine and Tehachapi Pass were closed for several hours by the snow, hindering travel between the San Joaquin Valley and southern California. This was a very deep low pressure system, and all-time low pressure records were set in both Bakersfield and Fresno; both reported 28.94 inches of mercury. This storm also brought very strong winds to the Kern County Mountains where 10 inch diameter tree branches were downed in the Grapevine area due to winds approaching 70 mph in gusts there.||The cold pool of air moved over the area on the afternoon of January 22nd, triggering strong convective showers, one of which blanketed parts of the city of Clovis with about 2-3 inches deep of pea-size hail on the ground; a funnel cloud was reported near Clovis Ave and State Route 168 in Clovis.||By the time the last storm moved east of the region, the total rainfall amounts in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley mostly were between 1.5 and 2.5 inches, with a few locations around 3 inches.

According to multiple accounts, the landspout began on the hillside NW of a small farm community, laying nearly flat a broad oak tree. As the landspout moved down the hill it likely went through a period of vortex stretching, allowing it to tighten up and spin a bit faster. Eyewitnesses say the landspout moved down off the hill and toward several small houses. It displaced two normal sized steel dumpsters about 30 yards in the direction of its travel. Along this flat land portion of the path the landspout encountered two oak trees, tearing off several large branches (3in diameter) and depositing them 20-30 yards away in a downpath direction. Damage assessment indicates the landspout weakened significantly while passing over several small housing structures and brushing by a barn. Once past these structures it encountered another downhill slope and re-intensified. The landspout then encountered a pole barn with a small to moderate size trailer parked beneath. There were no visible signs of damage to the trailer, but the pole barn showed significant roof damage. It is estimated that about half of the roof from the pole barn was damaged or torn off with this debris strewn about the area. Rotation is easily confirmed due to debris locations. Parts of the roof were thrown orthogonally to the right of the direction of movement, as far as 40 to 50 yards. Other portions of the roof were lifted up, taken with the landspout and scattered across a neighboring vineyard. The farthest deposit away from the pole barn is estimated at about 60 to 80 yards, along the landspout path to the southeast.

An upper level trough and associated cold front entered the North Bay early in the day and then moved southward through the entire Bay Area by the afternoon. The passing frontal boundary and cold air aloft help to set the stage for afternoon thunderstorms. Computer weather models forecasted the mid to late afternoon thunderstorm potential rather well. The GFS model imagery below depicts the passage of the upper level trough/low and associated precipitation. The NAM model imagery below depicts forecast surface based convective available potential energy (CAPE). In other words, CAPE is the measure of instability in the lower atmosphere (full definition here). Note the higher values of CAPE over northern Napa County and southern Monterey/San Benito Counties.||The cold frontal passage earlier in the day brought mostly stratiform rain to the Bay Area impacting the morning commute. However, after noon enough instability was present and thunderstorms began to develop over Monterey/San Benito Counties. See the radar animation below. These developing thunderstorms continued to track south and develop even further (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Through radar interrogation it was determined that this particular thunderstorm contained hail. The question was, how big? After utilizing dual pol radar imagery and radar cross sections evidence was growing that larger hail could be present. One technique meteorologists use for analyzing hail is the strength of the radar returns above 0C and especially - 20C. In the image below, higher returns were easily seen above the 0C line and -20C. As a result, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued with the main threats being hail of one inch and wind gusts to 60 mph. We had one report of hail associated with thunderstorm. Enough hail fell to cover the ground white and make it look like it snowed (picture).||Another notable thunderstorm that developed during the afternoon was located over northern Napa County (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Thunderstorms developed north of Lake Berryessa and began tracking south(see radar image below). This particular thunderstorm eventually began to indicate weak rotation. The rotation detected on the KDAX radar ended up being a short-live waterspout. Confirmation of the waterspout was eventually reported via social media (see picture). In short, a waterspout is a tornado over water (full definition here).",132
